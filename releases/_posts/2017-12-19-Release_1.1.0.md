Boomaga 1.1.0 is out!
=====================
We are glad to announce a new version of the boomaga. The most noticeable change are:

* Fix: Sometimes the backend has incorrectly defined environment variables.
* Fix in cmake: Allow to use system build flags
* Fix: Install correct values in boomaga.ppd.
* Updated translations.
