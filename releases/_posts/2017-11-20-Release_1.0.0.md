Boomaga 1.0.0 is out!
=====================
We are glad to announce a new version of the boomaga. The most noticeable change are:

* Previously, the program used private methods from poppler. This caused a lot of problems. Now the program uses its own parser, written from scratch.
* Add "Flip on long edge" and "Flip on short edge" options in the printer preferences dialog.
* Improved display and print for some not quite correct PDF files.
* Fix: typos.
* Updated translations.
