Boomaga 0.8.0 is out!
=====================
We are glad to announce a new version of the boomaga. The most noticeable change are:


* You can see previews of all sub-booklets, and quickly switch of them.
* Scrolling speed now depends on the mouse wheel speed.
* Some GUI improvements.
* Add shortcuts for prev. and next page view.
* Fix: Sometimes the rendering of the page hides the frame.
* Fix: Sometimes the program can not find a helper utility (boomagamerger).
* Add ${LIB_SUFFIX} for installation at x86_64
* The CUPS backend was rewritten on C++. This eliminated the some problems, for example escaping characters.
* Asynchronous processing of DBUS messages.
* Updated translations.
