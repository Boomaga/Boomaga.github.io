Ubuntu
======
Boomaga is available from Ubuntu repositories and can be installed via the Software Center or with this command in a terminal:

    sudo apt-get install boomaga

<br>
But it usually takes months for new versions of a package to reach the official repositories so they may quickly become outdated. That is why it is preferred to install Boomaga from [our PPA repositories](https://launchpad.net/~boomaga/+archive/ppa), which are available for all modern Ubuntu releases. Open up a terminal and input these commands:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:boomaga
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install boomaga
